## Explainable Techniques II

This notebook demonstrates how to use PDP, Ice Plots and Ale Plots to generate global explanations. The data used for this notebook is the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" from Kaggle. 
The dataset is designed to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. All patients surveyed in this dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
